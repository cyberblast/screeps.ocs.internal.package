### Installation

1. Install Node  
  https://nodejs.org/en/

2. Install the grunt CLI (using admin rights/sudo if required)  
  `npm install -g grunt-cli`  

3. Clone repository and submodules  
  * via CLI  
    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/cyberblast/screeps.ocs.internal.package.git`  
  * via Github Desktop
    Click the plus sign at the top left corner, click clone and select `cyberblast`, then `screeps.ocs.internal.package`.  

4. Install dependencies after changing directory into the newly cloned work area
  ```
  cd creeps.ocs.internal.package
  npm i
  ```

5. Create a screeps.json file (copy example.screeps.json) & enter screeps account login data  
  `cp example.screeps.json screeps.json`

### Usage

1. Commands
  * to build (without deployment)  
  `grunt`  
  * to build & deploy  
  `grunt deploy`  
  * to build & deploy automatically upon saving  
  `grunt watch`  
  * to build & publish to a folder (define in screeps.json)  
  `grunt publish`  

2. After your first deployment using this repository, please call `delete Memory.modules;` from within the screeps console, to update module references. 
  *required only once*  

3. You may want to create a directory called `overrides`. Here you'll be able to place `custom.*` and `viral.*` files that will be merged eventually.  
Please note, that it is required to call `getPath('<originalModuleNameWithoutExtension>', true)`, when adding a new `custom.*` or `viral.*` file to bust the cache and enable it.
